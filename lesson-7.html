        <h2>Opener</h2>

        <p>
          I always wait till the end of writing instruction to teach students
          how to start their essay. If I thought this in the beginning, students
          waste a lot of time being creative. This is a no no.
        </p>

        <p>
          Expositor writing, is a skilled aspect of learning. Our MC123
          technique allows you to rapidly improve your writing. Quality and
          creativity comes with practice the same with adding vocabularies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be weary of writing a creative essay. That defeats the purpose of
          expository writing.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are under time constraints you want to make sure your writing
          is clear, concise and coherent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try the following opener <span class="under">"It is facile".</span>,
          This means it is easy.
        </p>

        <p>
          So let's look at our original prompt about Donald Trump. Look at the
          following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="under"
            >It is facile to look at Donald Trump's bombastic manor.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>Now follow with the prompt:</p>
        <p>Donald Trump is a wonderful President.</p>

        <p>Delineate your examples.</p>

        <p>Let’s take the converse (if this is your view).</p>

        <p>
          It is facile to look at the President’s economic record. Clearly, the
          President is no the best president our nation has had this century.
        </p>

        <p>Now delineate your examples.</p>

        <p>
          So let’s recap. We have learned to rapidly outline. Then we learned
          how to write our opening paragraph. Moreover, we learned how to use
          connectors to make our body paragraphs easier to read. Finally, we
          learned how to write the final paragraph.
        </p>

        <!-- Now we learned how to use connectors to make our body -->
        <p>
          As your writing improves, your love of American English will expand.
        </p>

          has helped millions of students improve their writing. Our students
          have gone onto superior academic and career success.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be weary of billionaires convincing you that computers will do all the
          writing. Writing is a necessary skill.
